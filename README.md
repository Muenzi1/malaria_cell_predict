## Machine learning on the Malaria Cell Images Dataset 

In this project different machine learning models were derived and tested to detect malaria infected cells based on simple microscopy images. 

While Decision Tree based algortihms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) were fairly good classifiers, support
vector machines showed a horrible performance. Finally, convolutional neural networks were tested and outperformed
all classical machine learning approaches easily. 

As the resources of the local machine used were limited, all the notebook was processed via Google Colab.
